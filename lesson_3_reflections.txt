When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When you want to keep an off-site version or if you want to invite collaborators.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may not want changes made remotely to interrupt the work you are doing locally.
