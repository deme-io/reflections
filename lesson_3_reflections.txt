When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When you want to keep an off-site version or if you want to invite collaborators.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  You may not want changes made remotely to interrupt the work you are doing locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks clone repositories on GitHub
  Clones clone repositries from GitHub to your local repository or from a local to a local repository
  Branches clones an individual commit
  
  You would create a new branch to experiement implementing a new feature set
  You would clone when you wanted to add to someone's entire body of work
  You would fork when you want to clone someone's body of work on GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So you can make changes and know you have the current version if you need to work offline.
